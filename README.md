Hey everyone, I'm posting reworked/remastered/original scripts here, like notes. 😊.


Tutorial for the executor


1 - Click on the file you need


2 - Click the raw button in the top right


3 - After clicking the raw button, copy the website link [Something like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ :) ]


4 - Then paste the link into this


--- loadstring(game:HttpGet())() ----


P.S - Insert your link between the ())
This works with all raw links lol ^-^



5 - Execute the script in your executor (Roblox Executors)

Done! If the script doesn't work, it's been modified so it doesn't run, or you have a bad executor that doesn't understand the script XD
