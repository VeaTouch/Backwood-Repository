Hey everyone, I'm posting reworked/remastered/original scripts here, like notes. 😊.
Tutorial for the executor
1 - Click on the file you need
2 - Click the "raw" button in the top right
3 - After clicking the "raw" button, copy the website link [Something like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ :) ]
4 - Then paste the link into this
--- loadstring(game:HttpGet(your raw link))() ----
P.S - Remove the word "your raw link" and paste the actual raw link
WARNING - This works with all raw links lol ^-^
5 - Execute the script in your executor (Roblox Executors)
Done! If the script doesn't work, it's been modified so it doesn't run, or you have a bad executor that doesn't understand the script XD
